- Fetch titles of pages when you give a URL and fail resource add if URL doesn't load

- import a product and a venue to show what I mean





write patrick, etc

I’ve changed http://ourlives.herokuapp.com/ quite a bit.  I think it’s almost usable on desktop now.  I actually got rid of time desires, and I’m just using identity desires for now.  Make sure to check it out on github https://github.com/jxe/ourlives.  It also now supports some nifty direct urls.  For instance, my profile:  http://ourlives.herokuapp.com/#user/facebook:514190  and about facebook.com:  http://ourlives.herokuapp.com/#url/facebook.com

Note that the “alternatives” doesn’t even take into account the value dag or reviews yet, it just pulls the first activity listed under each goal.

CLEANUP


============================




v0.2 -- inventory
==============================
- switch yield null over to yield* ask() and put the other yield in the ask
- three tabs:  game, inventory, map
- tips -> inventory
- inventory is saved on the server side, by user id
- new lifestyle button switches to a two-input form
- sort lifestyles by city name



v0.3 -- can replace sandbar
===========================
- add support for helpful links and images
- add support for sand dock install


v0.4 -- watering hole
=====================
- watering hole tab shows things that need work (don't have enough ratings, may need name changes, need helpful links or images)
- merge tool
45

v0.5 -- ???
===========================
- keep a "better_count" and "worse_count"
- sort activities_by_desire by better_count
- sort activities_by_lifestyle by better_count also? or just compare count?

FIX PROBLEMS

- "start over" button in data entry


CLEANUP
- replace all lists with twitter's typeahead.js
- center prompt text and typeahead box with d3 stuff right above and "Add your experience.."
- switch yield null over to yield* ask() and put the other yield in the ask


============================


- bring back locations/cities




v0.1 -- refactor & first cut of the d3.js map
==================================
- three tabs:  game, inventory, map
- d3.js
- map loads all activities and builds better_than/worse_than edges



v0.2 -- inventory
==============================
- tips -> inventory
- inventory is saved on the server side, by user id
- new lifestyle button switches to a two-input form
- sort lifestyles by city name



v0.3 -- can replace sandbar
===========================
- add support for helpful links and images
- add support for sand dock install


v0.4 -- watering hole
=====================
- watering hole tab shows things that need work (don't have enough ratings, may need name changes, need helpful links or images)


v0.5 -- ???
===========================
- keep a "better_count" and "worse_count"
- sort activities_by_desire by better_count
- sort activities_by_lifestyle by better_count also? or just compare count?

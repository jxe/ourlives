CLEANUP


============================




v0.2 -- inventory
==============================
- switch yield null over to yield* ask() and put the other yield in the ask
- three tabs:  game, inventory, map
- tips -> inventory
- inventory is saved on the server side, by user id
- new lifestyle button switches to a two-input form
- sort lifestyles by city name



v0.3 -- can replace sandbar
===========================
- add support for helpful links and images
- add support for sand dock install


v0.4 -- watering hole
=====================
- watering hole tab shows things that need work (don't have enough ratings, may need name changes, need helpful links or images)
- merge tool
45

v0.5 -- ???
===========================
- keep a "better_count" and "worse_count"
- sort activities_by_desire by better_count
- sort activities_by_lifestyle by better_count also? or just compare count?
